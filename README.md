# Healthcare Disease Prediction: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Kidney Disease

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of patients having chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease) based on medical attributes. The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow from data collection to model deployment.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository:

1. **Diabetes Dataset** - Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
2. **Heart Disease Dataset** - Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset
3. **Kidney Disease Dataset** - Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset

## Features

Common features across datasets include:
- Age, Gender
- Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)
- Blood Sugar Levels
- Cholesterol Levels
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Family History of Disease
- Smoking/Alcohol Habits
- Physical Activity
- Disease-specific features (e.g., Serum Creatinine for kidney disease)

## Target Variable

Binary Classification:
- 1: Disease present
- 0: Disease absent
